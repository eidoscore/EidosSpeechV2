# GitHub Public APIs - Ready to Submit

## 📋 EXACT Entry to Add

**Location:** Find the section in README.md (it's NOT "Text - Speech", it's under a different category)

Based on the repo, eidosSpeech should go under **"Development"** or create new **"Text & Speech"** category.

### Option 1: Add to "Development" Category

```markdown
| [eidosSpeech](https://eidosspeech.xyz) | Free text-to-speech API with 1,200+ voices in 75+ languages | `apiKey` | Yes | Yes |
```

### Option 2: If there's a Speech/Audio category

```markdown
| [eidosSpeech](https://eidosspeech.xyz) | Free text-to-speech API with 1,200+ voices in 75+ languages | `apiKey` | Yes | Yes |
```

**Note:** I saw "IBM Text to Speech" in the list, so find where that is and add eidosSpeech nearby in alphabetical order (eidosSpeech comes BEFORE IBM alphabetically).
