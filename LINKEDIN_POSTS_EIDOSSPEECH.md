# LinkedIn Posts - 5 Days Content Calendar for eidosSpeech

## Day 1: Introduction Post (Monday)

**Hook:** The problem-solution approach

---

yo content creators, real talk 💬

remember when you needed AI voiceovers and had to:
- pay $30/month for 10 minutes of audio 💸
- deal with robotic voices that sound like 2010 GPS 🤖
- pray your credits don't run out mid-project 🙏

yeah, we said nah to all that.

introducing eidosSpeech — free text-to-speech that actually sounds human.

1,200+ voices. 75+ languages. $0 forever.

no cap, no credit card, no BS. just voices that slap.

perfect for:
✨ YouTube videos
✨ TikTok content
✨ Podcasts
✨ Audiobooks
✨ literally anything

built different. built for creators who just wanna create.

## Day 2: Feature Spotlight (Tuesday)

**Hook:** Show, don't tell

---

POV: you need voiceovers for your content 🎙️

other TTS tools: "that'll be $29.99/month for 30 minutes"
eidosSpeech: "here's 1,200+ voices, unlimited. it's free"

them: "choose from 5 robotic voices"
us: "pick from 1,200+ neural voices in 75+ languages"

them: "download as WAV, convert it yourself"
us: "instant MP3 download, ready for your editor"

them: "10 minute limit per audio"
us: "generate what you need, when you need it"

we're not here to gatekeep voices. we're here to let you cook.

free TTS. free API. free forever.

because good tools shouldn't cost your coffee money.

## Day 3: Behind the Scenes (Wednesday)

**Hook:** Founder story / Why we built this

---

why did we build eidosSpeech? 🤔

because we were tired of:

❌ "free trial" that gives you 2 minutes of audio
❌ subscription fatigue for basic features
❌ voices that sound like they're underwater
❌ character limits that kill your creativity
❌ "upgrade to premium" every 5 seconds

so we built what we wanted to use.

real free tier. no bait and switch.
1,200+ natural-sounding voices.
API access for developers.
no paywalls. ever.

we're creators building for creators.

if you've ever rage-quit a TTS tool because of limits, this is for you.

currently live:
✅ 1,200+ AI voices
✅ 75+ languages (including Indonesian, Japanese, Korean)
✅ Multi-voice scripts (NEW!)
✅ Subtitle generation
✅ Voice styles & emotions
✅ REST API with 30 req/day free

join the movement. create without limits.
