Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm excited to share eidosSpeech - a completely free text-to-speech API I built to make AI voice generation accessible to everyone.

The Problem:
Most TTS APIs are expensive or require credit cards for "free" tiers. This creates barriers for students, hobbyists, and developers in developing countries.

The Solution:
eidosSpeech provides 1,200+ neural voices across 75+ languages, completely free. No credit card, no hidden fees.

Tech Stack:
- FastAPI (Python)
- Microsoft Edge TTS
- SQLite
- Docker

What's Next:
- More voices
- Voice customization (pitch, speed)
- Batch processing
- Webhooks

I'd love your feedback! What features would you want to see? What use cases do you have in mind?

Try it out and let me know what you think! 🚀
